# FEM lab assignments

This repository contains full implementations from the ground up of [finite element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) implemented in Numpy. 

## Problems

The solved problems are:
- A 1D steady-state diffusion reaction equation,
- A 2D area minimisation with Dirichlet boundary conditions (soap film).

## Soap film example
